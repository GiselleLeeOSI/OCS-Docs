# Manage tenants in a community

The Community Details page lets you perform various tasks for managing tenants belonging to a community.

To create a new community, see [Add a community](xref:AddCommunity).

## Add another tenant to a community

## Pause or resume sharing data with a tenant

## Remove a tenant from a community

## Remove your own tenant from a community

## Delete a community

From the Community Details page, you can delete a community. The ability to delete a community lets you limit access to a community to only those users who need it and when they need it. After you delete a community, no users can access it again.

**Note:** Only a Community Administrator or a Tenant Administrator can perform this procedure.

1. On the navigation bar, click **Communities**.
2. On the Communities page, find the community you want to delete and click **Details**.
3. On the Community Details page, click **More Options** ![More Options](..\images\MoreOptions.png "More Options") at top right and select **Delete Community** from the pop-up menu.
4. Confirm the deletion by entering the name of the community to be deleted and clicking **Delete**.
