# Manage tenants in a community

The Community Details page lets you perform various tasks for managing tenants belonging to a community.

To create a new community, see [Add a community](xref:AddCommunity).

## Add a tenant to a community

OCS lets you invite business partners to join a community so they are enabled to share data. The business partner must already be a tenant in OCS.

Two different users must perform this procedure:

- One user, the "inviter," issues an invitation to another tenant to join a community.
- A user in another tenant, the "invitee," accepts the invitation.

**Note.** Only an OCS user whose role is Community Administrator, Community Moderator, or Tenant Administrator can be an inviter. Only an OCS user whose role is a Tenant Administrator or Community Administrator can be an invitee.  

1. **Inviter:** Perform the following steps:
 1.1. On the Communities overview page, find the community you want to share and click **Details**.
 1.2. On the Community Details page, on the Tenant card, click **New Tenant**.
 1.3. Enter the email address of the representative of the tenant you would like to invite and click **Invite**. An email is sent to that representative, that is, the “invitee.”
2. **Invitee:** Perform the following steps:
 2.1 Open the email from OSIsoft Cloud Services and click **VIEW COMMUNITY INVITE**. OCS opens and displays a login dialog.
 2.2. Enter the name of your tenant and click **Continue**. A dialog for verifying identity appears.
 2.3. Verify your identity. OCS displays a page saying that that your tenant will be joining the community from which the invite was issued.
 2.4. Click **Join**. The user who sent the invitation, that is, the “inviter,” receives an email asking for confirmation of the pending invitation.
3. **Inviter:** Perform the following steps:
 3.1. Click **VIEW PENDING INVITATIONS**. After authentication, the Community Details page opens and shows that an invitation awaits confirmation.  
 3.2. Select the tenant with the pending confirmation, select **More Options** ![More Options](..\images\more-options-wite-background.png "More Options"), and click Confirm Tenant. When prompted for confirmation, click Confirm Tenant again.
