# Manage a community

The Communities page lets you perform overall tasks for managing communities, such as adding or deleting a community. See <Manage tenants in a community> to specify the clients, users, and roles for particular tenant in a community.

## Create a community

When you create a community, you are defining a space where an external business partner can collaborate and share data. The community is private; no one outside of the community should be aware of its existence.

**Note:** Only a community owner can perform this procedure.

1. On the navigation bar, click **Communities**.
2. On the Communities page, click **Add Communities**.
3. Enter a name and description for the new community and click *Enter*. The community is added to the Communities page.

## Delete a community

From the Community Details page, you can delete a community. The ability to delete a community lets you limit access to a community to only those users who need it and when they need it. After you delete a community, no users can access it again.

**Note:** Only a community owner or a tenant administrator can perform this procedure. ??API says community administrator or account administrator. Is this the tenant administrator for the tenant that created the community???
1. On the navigation bar, click **Communities**.
2. On the Communities page, find the community you want to delete and click **Details**.
3. On the Community Details page, click **More Options** ![More Options](..\images\MoreOptions.png "More Options") at top right and select **Delete Community** from the pop-up menu.
4. Confirm the deletion by entering the name of the community to be deleted and clicking **Delete**.
