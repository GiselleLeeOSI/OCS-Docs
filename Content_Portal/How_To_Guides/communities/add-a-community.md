# Create a community

When you create a community, you are defining a space where an external business partner can collaborate and share data. The community is private; no one outside of the community should be aware of its existence.

For information about managing an existing community, see [Manage tenants in a community](xref:manage-community).

**Note:** Only a Tenant Administrator can perform this procedure.

1. On the navigation bar, click **Communities**.
2. On the Communities page, click **Add Communities**.
3. Enter a name and description for the new community and click **Enter**. The community is added to the Communities page.
