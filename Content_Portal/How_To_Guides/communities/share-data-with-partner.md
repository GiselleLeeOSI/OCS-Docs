4. Select one or more streams to share.
5. Select **More Options** ![More Options](..\images\MoreOptions.png "More Options") and select **Share Stream** from the drop-down menu.<br>If you selected multiple streams, a pane appears for managing streams. You can select **Share Streams** on that pane.
6.. Click **Select Communities**.<br>A list of communities appears.
8. Select the communities with which you want to share the selected streams and click **Continue**. If necessary, you can filter communities by typing in the **Filter Communities** text box.
