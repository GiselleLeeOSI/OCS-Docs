# Communities

OCS Communities help industrial users share operational data with their external business partners, service providers, and analytics providers. Sharing data helps OCS users generate more value from their data.

Your data can be shared with one or more communities so others in those communities can see it. At any time, you can choose to stop sharing your data.

To use OCS Communities, you must be assigned to one or more [roles that grant permissions](xref:communityroles) allowing you to use and manage a community.

Some random scenarios

- share data with users (such as contractors) without bringing them inside your corporate firewall
- helps prevent rogue data sharing (such as passed-around Excel spreadsheets)
- share data with customers so they can feel assured they are getting what they paid for (for example Dominion Power generation)
- share data without being onsite, necessary in a COVID world
