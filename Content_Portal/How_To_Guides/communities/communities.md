# Communities

OCS Communities help industrial users share operational data with communities of other users, including external business partners, service providers, and analytics providers. Typically, sharing data can be costly, insecure, and difficult to manage, but with Communities, OCS users can:

- Share data with partners without managing security for those partners or bringing them inside the corporate firewall.
- Share data without requiring users to be onsite.
- Share data with users who do not have a PI System or other required software.
- Share data with customers to assure them that they are getting the services they requested.
- Avoid unauthorized data sharing by knowing who has access to data while also having the capability to turn off data access at any time.

FROM MARKETING: Vendors and partners can gain real-time visibility into equipment status and performance so that they can proactively schedule maintenance or order replacement parts. A company can coordinate with local utilities and agencies to take advantage of lower rates or rebates for shifting resource consumption.

# Share data with a partner

The following procedure describes the high-level process needed to share data using Communities. The process provides links to all the procedures need to create a community, populate it with tenants, users, and clients, and then share data.

This procedure is in development

1. [Create a community](xref:add-community). 
2. [Invite another OCS tenant](xref:managecommunity#add-a-tenant-to-a-community) to join the community.
3. [Add users](xref:managecommunityusers#add-users-to-a-community) to the community.
4. [Add clients](xref:managecommunityclients#add-clients-to-a-community) to the community.
