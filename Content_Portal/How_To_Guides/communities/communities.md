# Communities

OCS Communities help industrial users share operational data with communities of other users, including external business partners, service providers, and analytics providers. 

For example, with Communities, OCS users can:

- Share data with partners without bringing those users inside the corporate firewall or taking extra security precautions.
- Share data without requiring users to be onsite.
- Share data with users who do not have a PI System or other required software.
- Avoid unauthorized data sharing by always knowing who has access to data.
- Turn off access to data at any time.

## Preliminary considerations

To use Communities, you must have the necessary entitlements. If you cannot access Communities, contact your [account manager](https://customers.osisoft.com/s/contactus "Contact Us").

When using Communities, you assign roles that grant levels of permission. Typically, you assign roles when [adding users](xref:managecommunityusers#add-users-to-a-community) to a community. For more information about available roles, see [Community roles](xref:communityroles).

## Share data with a partner

The following process lists the high-level steps that are needed to share data. The process consists of creating a community, populating it with tenants, users, and clients, and then sharing data.

**This procedure is still in development**

1. [Create a community](xref:add-community). 
2. [Invite another OCS tenant](xref:managecommunity#add-a-tenant-to-a-community) to join the community.
3. [Add users](xref:managecommunityusers#add-users-to-a-community) to the community.
4. [Add clients](xref:managecommunityclients#add-clients-to-a-community) for programmatic access to the community.
5. Share data --- TBD
6.
