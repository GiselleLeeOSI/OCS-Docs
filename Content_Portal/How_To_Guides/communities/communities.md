# Communities

OCS communities help industrial users share operational data with their external business partners, service providers, and analytics providers. Sharing data helps OCS users generate more value from their data.

Some random scenarios

- share data with users (such as contractors) without bringing them inside your corporate firewall
- helps prevent rogue data sharing (such as passed-around Excel spreadsheets)
- share data with customers so they can feel assured they are getting what they paid for (for example Dominion Power generation)
- share data without being onsite, necessary in a COVID world

## Community roles

When using Communities, you may need to assign the following roles:

### Community Owner

The tenant who created the community. Currently, only this one tenant can be the Community Owner.

### Community Administrator

The role assigned to the user within the Community Owner tenant who created the community. Community Admins can also assign other users the Community Admin role, but only to users within their own tenant (that is, the Community Owner's tenant).

### Community Moderator

The role assigned to the user within a community "member tenant" that manages the community for their tenant. This is usually the person that accepted the invitation on behalf of his or her community. This user must also be an Account Administrator within their own tenant.

### Community Member

### Account Administrator

A tenant-level role assigned to users within a tenant that allows those users to administer their own tenant. Note that this user role will eventually be renamed "Tenant Administrator".

### Data Steward

Need a definition of a data steward
