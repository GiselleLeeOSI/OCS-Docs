OCS communities help industrial users share operational data with their external business partners, service providers, and analytics providers. Sharing data helps OCS users generate more value from their data.

Some random scenarios

- share data with users (such as contractors) without bringing them inside your corporate firewall
- helps prevent rogue data sharing (such as passed-around Excel spreadsheets)
- share data with customers so they can feel assured they are getting what they paid for (for example Dominion Power generation)
- share data without being onsite, necessary in a COVID world
