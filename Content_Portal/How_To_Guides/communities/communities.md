# Communities

OCS Communities help industrial users share operational data with communities of other users, including external business partners, service providers, and analytics providers. Sharing data helps OCS users generate more value from their data.

For example, OCS users can use Communities in the following scenarios:

- Sharing data with users such as contractors without bringing them inside your corporate firewall.
- Avoiding unauthorized data sharing such as rogue spreadsheets being passed around
- Sharing data with customers to assure them that they are getting the services they paid for.
- Sharing data with other users without requiring them to be onsite.

## Basics of using Communities

To use Communities, you must have the necessary entitlements. If you cannot access Communities, contact your [account manager](https://customers.osisoft.com/s/contactus "Contact Us").

When using Communities, you are assigned certain roles that grant you varying levels of permissions to use and manage a community. For more information, see [Community roles](xref:communityroles).

For a high-level view of the process needed to share data, see [Share data with a partner](xref:share-data-with-partner).

Your data can be shared with one or more communities so others in those communities can see it. At any time, you can choose to stop sharing your data.
