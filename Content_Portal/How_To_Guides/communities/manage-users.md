# Manage users in a community

The Community Details page lets you add and delete community users. It also lets you assign roles to users.

## Add users to a community

2. On the Community Details page, on the **Users** tab, click **New User** ![New User](..\images\Add_Button.png "New User").
3. Select users or groups of users. If necessary, you can filter the list of users by typing characters in the **Filter users** box.
4. Select the roles to apply to users being added. In addition to the basic Community Member role, you can assign these specialized roles:
