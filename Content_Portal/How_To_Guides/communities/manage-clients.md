# Add and remove community clients

The Community Details page lets you add and delete clients, which are headless applications that can authenticate to OCS and gain programmatic access to shared data and resources.

To perform these procedures, you must be a [Community Administrator](xref:communityroles#community-administrator) or [Community Moderator](xref:communityroles#community-moderator).

## Add clients to a community

1. On the Communities overview page, find the community where you want to add clients and click **Details**.

3. Click **Add Client**.
4. Select the clients to add. If necessary, you can filter the list of clients by typing characters in the **Filter users** box. If you need to create a client in OCS before adding it to the community, use the Security feature in OCS.
5. Click **Add**.
